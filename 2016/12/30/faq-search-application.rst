FAQ

Tidbits are the small and particularly interesting item of information
that we use in a day to day professional life.

We often note such information down on some form of Sticky notes. They
may be actual sticky notes that we stick on our Monitors

or `Google keep`_.

These are quite limited in their use because not everyone has access to
it. On the other hand shared documents like `Google docs`_ are
accessible by everyone but are not good for maintaining short notes.

These tidbits of information will have greater impact if many people can
contribute to it, is organised and is searchable by everyone. This
thought and the wish to play with `elasticsearch`_ and `angularjs`_ led
me to create a minimalist FAQ search app. The app works directly out of
the box and people can contribute articles into it formatted with
Markdown. The elastic backend helps make the storage simple and the
search easy.
