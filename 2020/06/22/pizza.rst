Recipe
------

For the dough
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Slightly warm the water.
2. Dissolve the sugar and yeast in the water.
3. Add half the flour and mix until it forms a paste. Leave it alone for 15 minutes until you see bubbles in the paste and it has risen slightly.
4. Add the rest of the flour, salt, oil and any seasoning you want to add to the dough.
5. Knead the dough for 15 minutes until it forms a smooth ball. Add a spoon of flour while kneading if you feel the dough is too stiky.
6. Apply a thin film of oil on this dough ball and let it proof in a closed space for an hour or until it doubles in size.
7. After (6), punch the dough to remove all the air that has accumulated in the dough. At this point the dough is ready for pizza.

NOTE: You can follow steps 1-7 and store the dough for future use. If you intend to make pizza the next day you put the dough in fridge and if you plan to make pizza after a couple of days, you can store the dough in freezer and move it to fridge a day or two before making pizza.

NOTE: Resting the dough in the fridge for a day actually makes it taste beter.

For the marinara sauce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Heat oil in a thick base pan.
2. Saute the garlic.
3. Mash or grid the tomato into a puree and add it to the pan once garlic has turned golden.
4. Add a pinch of salt and sugar. You can add herbs like rosemary/thyme into it if you like.
5. Slow cook this for atleast 30 minutes.

Cooking pizza
-------------

1. Flatten the dough into a circle on a pizza pan or cast iron skillet.
2. Poke holes into the base using a fork to ensure no air bubbles are present.
3. Apply the sauce evenly on the surface.
4. Add 3/4th of the shreded cheeze evenly.
5. Add cut up vegetables and add the rest of the cheeze over it.
6. Bake the pizza in oven at 400F for 25-30 minutes until the visible part of the crust is golden brown in colour.
