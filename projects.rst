I maintain a list of ideas which are primarily the results of phrases
like **“I wonder why something like this doesn’t exist”** or **“This is
way too complex, there should be a simple alternative to it”** or
**“There should be an open source alternative to this tool”**.

I work on them whenever time permits. Some of them are on my `Github`_
account. A few good ones are listed here.
