About Me
--------

I am Vishwas B Sharma.
I graduated from the `Computer Science Department`_ at `Stony Brook
University`_ in December 2013. There, I worked under `Prof. Steven
Skiena`_, at the `Data Science Lab`_ building pipelines to process
massive amounts of text to be used as training data for Parts of Speech
and Named Entity Recognition models. I also used these models to create
fun applications like the one displayed `here`_.

My primary research interest lies in Design and Analysis of Algorithms,
but I dabble in everything from Machine Learning, Game Theory to
Computer Graphics. In my free time I like to cook, pencil sketch and
play video games.

I currently work as a Software Engineer at `Lyft`_.
