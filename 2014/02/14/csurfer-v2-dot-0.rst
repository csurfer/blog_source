  Why I moved away from wordpress?

csurfer-version-2.0
===================

Why the new website ?
---------------------

I need a website. After the tragic demise of my old website hosted on
`HIOX.com`_, after it got `hacked by Bagladeshi Black Hat hackers`_, I
never got the time to resurrect my website. The fact that its working
now means that I am bored and I have free time on my hands.

Why Octopress ?
---------------

Firstly one should learn from their mistakes. But when I got hacked I
couldn’t figure out where exactly the problem was. Was it the cPanel of
`HIOX.com <http://hiox.com>`__ which was faulty or did the attack
originate from the loop hole in `Wordpress`_ plugin which I used to
power my blog ? Wordpress team says that it was due to mistake of the
website owners on their `support site`_ but then I am not a person who
leaves too many loose ends nor uses weak passwords(I may not know too
much but I do know a thing or two).

Second the idea of a statically generated website intrigues me. After
all `metaprogramming`_ is cool. Who wouldn’t love the idea of a program
which writes a program. I mean thats one of the ways you can enter
Nolan’s shoes.

Thirdly I fell in love with `Markdown`_ when I was documenting my
research work in my `lab`_ and Octopress provides me with the option to
write my blog posts in markdown.

What to expect in future ?
